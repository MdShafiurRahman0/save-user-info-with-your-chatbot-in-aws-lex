# Why isn't the intent working?

No matter which utterance you use, you will just get an error response. This is because the FollowupCheckBalance intent's input context isn't available yet. The intent doesn't know your birthday!

1. For your second test, ask for a balance in your account - activate the CheckBalance intent first.
2. Then, the context for date of birth will be carried over to the FollowupCheckBalance intent.
